# Homogeneity: A clustering result satisfies homogeneity if all of its clusters contain only data points which are members of a single class.
# Completeness: A clustering result satisfies completeness if all the data points that are members of a given class are elements of the same cluster.
# V-measure: The V-measure is the harmonic mean between homogeneity and completeness.
# This metric is independent of the absolute values of the labels: a permutation of the class or cluster label values wonâ€™t change the score value in any way.

# To run this script, take the gmm_outputs(membership) as preds, and the ground truth label(category) of the dataset as labels.
# num_clusters is the number of clusters(K), and num_labels is the number of true categories in the dataset.
# For example:
# preds = np.array([[0.8,0.2], [0.9,0.1], [0.1,0.9], [0.2,0.9]])
# labels = np.array([0, 0, 1, 1])
# print(v_measure(preds, labels, num_clusters, num_labels))
